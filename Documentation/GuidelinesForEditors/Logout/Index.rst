Logout
^^^^^^

When you finished your work as an editor in TYPO3, make sure to
explicitly logout from the system. This is very important if you are
sharing the computer with other people, such as colleagues, or if you
use a public computer in a library, hotel lobby or internet café. As
an additional security measure, you may want to clear the browser
cache and cookies after you have logged out and close the browser
software.

In the standard configuration of TYPO3 you will automatically be
logged out after 1 hour of inactivity or when you access TYPO3 with
another IP address.
