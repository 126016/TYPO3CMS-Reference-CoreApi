================================
Localization with Crowdin [beta]
================================

.. tip::

   The integration of Crowdin is currently in beta state. Once it is stabilized, it will be also available in installations using TYPO3 9 LTS.

What is Crowdin
---------------
Crowdin is a localization management platform and offers the core features essential for delivering great translation:

- **Single source**: Translate text once that is used in different versions and parts of the software.
- **Machine translation**: Let machines do the first pass and then human-translators can edit the suggestions.
- **Glossary**: we can use our own TYPO3 glossary to make sure specific words are properly translated (e.g. Template in german, TypoScript or SEO)
- **Translation memory**: we can reuse existing translations, no matter if done for the TYPO3 Core or an extension.
- **Crowdin** is a cloud-based content localization solution which offers a free plan for open source projects.

.. note::

   Crowdin is completely free of charge for open-source projects.


.. _crowdin-initiative:

Crowdin initiative
------------------
A TYPO3 initiative has been created which takes care of integrating Crowdin into TYPO3.
The initiativeâ€™s scope is to fulfill all features which have been available with Pootle and its integration.
