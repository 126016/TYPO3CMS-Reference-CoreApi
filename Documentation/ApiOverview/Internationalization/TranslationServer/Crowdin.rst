================================
Localization with Crowdin [beta]
================================

.. tip::

   The integration of Crowdin is currently in beta state. Once it is stabilized, it will be also available in installations using TYPO3 9 LTS.

What is Crowdin
---------------
Crowdin is a localization management platform and offers the core features essential for delivering great translation:

- **Single source**: Translate text once that is used in different versions and parts of the software.
- **Machine translation**: Let machines do the first pass and then human-translators can edit the suggestions.
- **Glossary**: we can use our own TYPO3 glossary to make sure specific words are properly translated (e.g. Template in german, TypoScript or SEO)
- **Translation memory**: we can reuse existing translations, no matter if done for the TYPO3 Core or an extension.
- **Crowdin** is a cloud-based content localization solution which offers a free plan for open source projects.

.. tip::

   Crowdin is completely free of charge for open-source projects.

Workflow
--------
The following workflow is used to bring a translation into a TYPO3 installation.

.. rst-class:: bignums

1. Creating translations

   The translations are managed on Crowdin at https://crowdin.com/project/typo3-cms.

   You can either translate all strings on the Crowdin platform or directly in the TYPO3 backend. This is described in detail at :ref:`crowdin-usage`.

2. Translation Export

   Once the translations are approved on Crowdin by a proof reader, those are automatically exported and copied to the translation server `beta-translation.typo3.org`.

   If interested in the technical details, take a look at the package XYZ TODO: Add link to repo.

3. Import translations into TYPO3 installations

   The translations can be downloaded within a TYPO3 installation.
   This is described at :ref:`xliff-translating-fetch`.

Crowdin initiative
------------------
A TYPO3 initiative has been created which takes care of integrating Crowdin into TYPO3.
The initiativeâ€™s scope is to fulfill all features which have been available with Pootle and its integration.
