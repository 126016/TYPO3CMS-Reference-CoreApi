Operating system and browser version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that you are using up-to-date software versions of your
browser and that you have installed the latest updates for your
operating system (such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux). Check
for software updates regularly and install security patches
immediately or at least as soon as possible.

It is also recommended to use appropriate tools for detecting viruses,
Trojans, keyloggers, rootkits and other "malware".
