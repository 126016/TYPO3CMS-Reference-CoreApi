Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good communication between several roles is essential to clarify
responsibilities and to coordinate the next steps when updates are
required, an attacked site needs to be restored or other security-
related actions need to be done as soon as possible.

A central point of contact, for example a person or a team responsible
for coordinating these actions, is generally a good idea. This also
lets others (e.g. integrators, editors, end-users) know, to whom they
can report issues.
