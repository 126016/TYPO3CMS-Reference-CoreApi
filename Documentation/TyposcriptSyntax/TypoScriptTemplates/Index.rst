TypoScript Templates
--------------------

TypoScript templates mainly consist of the Constants and the Setup field.
Each template can include other (static) templates, which can again
define values in their own Constants and Setup fields.

The TypoScript template configuration can be viewed and edited in the
**WEB > Template** module.

The objects, properties and conditions, which are available inside the
Setup field, can be found in the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>`.
