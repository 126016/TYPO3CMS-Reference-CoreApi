This chapter explains what admins need to know when working with files
and TYPO3. In particular it explains what to note when upgrading an
older version of TYPO3 to TYPO3 6.0 or later which uses FAL to handle files.

In case you're interested in the inner workings of FAL, you should
have a look at the
:ref:`architecture overview <architecture-overview>`.
