About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document describes the syntax of TypoScript. It also covers the
nature of TypoScript and what the differences are between the various
contexts in which it can be used (i.e. templates and TSconfig).

If the concept of TypoScript itself is not clear, please read the
appendix "What is TypoScript?". Otherwise feel free to ignore it.
