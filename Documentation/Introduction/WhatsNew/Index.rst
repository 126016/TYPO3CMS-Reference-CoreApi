What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

The latest version of the CGLs mostly contains more complete and
precise information about already existing guidelines. It also
reflects changes in the coding of TYPO3 CMS 6.0.

Furthermore the appendix which described how to properly set up
various IDEs for working with the TYPO3 CMS Core has been moved to the
wiki: http://wiki.typo3.org/PHP\_Editors\_/\_IDE\_for\_TYPO3
