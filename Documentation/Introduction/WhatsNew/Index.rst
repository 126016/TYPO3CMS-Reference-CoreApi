What's New
^^^^^^^^^^

Version 1.0.2 of the Security Guide is mainly a maintenance update: it takes
the new TYPO3 brand into account and reflects changes required to match with
TYPO3 6.0 (released: November 2012). Two configuration settings have been
added to the Install Tool section: warning_email_addr and warning_mode might
help to detect a hack attempt.

Furthermore, this version includes some minor housekeeping tasks such as
updating the occurance of deprecated TypoScript functions and the removal of
unused images.
