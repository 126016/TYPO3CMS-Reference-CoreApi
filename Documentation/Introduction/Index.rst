Introduction
============


.. _overview:

Overview
--------

TYPO3 is known for its extensibility. To really benefit from
this power, a complete documentation is needed: "Core APIs" aims to
provide such information to developers and administrators. Not all areas
are covered with the same amount of detail, but at least some pointers are provided.

The document does *not* contain any significant information about
the frontend of TYPO3. Creating templates, setting up TypoScript
objects etc. is not the scope of the document, it addresses the
*backend* part of the core only.

The TYPO3 Documentation Team hopes that this document will form a complete picture
of the TYPO3 Core architecture and the backend. It will hopefully be the reference
of choice in your work with TYPO3.


.. _code-examples:

Code examples
-------------

Many of the code examples found in this document come from the TYPO3
Core itself.

Quite a few others come from the "examples" and the "styleguide" extension. You can
install them if you want to try out these examples yourself and use them as
a basis for your own stuff.

Yet some other examples just belong to this manual. Some may be moved
to the "examples" extension at some later stage.

.. _dedication:

Dedication
----------

I want to dedicate this document to the people in the TYPO3 community
who have the  *discipline* to do the boring job of writing
documentation for their extensions or contribute to the TYPO3
documentation in general. It's great to have good coders, but it's
even more important to have coders with character to carry their work
through till the end - even when it means spending days writing good
documents. Go for completeness!
