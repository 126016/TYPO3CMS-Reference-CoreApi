About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security is taken very seriously by the developers of TYPO3 and
especially by the members of the official TYPO3 Security Team. It is
also in the interest of system administrators, website owners, editors
and everybody who is responsible for a TYPO3 site, to protect the site
and its content against various threats.

This document describes some typical risks and advises on how to
protect a TYPO3 site in order to ensure it is and stays secure and
stable. It also explains how the TYPO3 Security Team deals with
incidents, how security bulletins and security updates are published
and how system administrators should react when their system has been
compromised.

This document intends to replace the "TYPO3 Security Cookbook"
published in 2006, without being a simple checklist but a
comprehensive guide how to ensure security of a TYPO3 instance.

It is important to understand that security is not a condition â€“
security is a process with ongoing tasks and regular reviews are
essential.
