History
^^^^^^^

In 2006 Ekkehard Guembel and Michael Hirdes published a document
"TYPO3 Security Cookbook". It was a concise, technical guide for
system administrators to secure TYPO3 installations.

Over the years TYPO3 has become increasingly popular and thousands of
websites worldwide are powered by TYPO3. There was a need to update
and expand the Security Cookbook and to include information for non-
technical users.
