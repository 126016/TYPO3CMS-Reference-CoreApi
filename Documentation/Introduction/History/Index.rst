History
^^^^^^^

In 2006 Ekkehard Guembel and Michael Hirdes published a document
"TYPO3 Security Cookbook". It was a concise, technical guide for
system administrators to secure TYPO3 installations.

Over the years the TYPO3 project has become increasingly popular
and thousands of websites worldwide are powered by TYPO3 CMS.
There was a need to update and expand the Security Cookbook and
to include information for non-technical users.
