TSconfig
--------

TSconfig can be entered in page, backend user and backend group
records.

The TSconfig configuration of pages can be viewed in the page
properties and in the "Page TSconfig" submodule inside the
Web > Info module. The configuration of backend users and groups
can be evaluated inside the according record.

While the objects, properties and conditions are different,
the *syntax* of TSconfig is basically the same as it is for
TypoScript in TypoScript templates.

The objects, properties and conditions, which are available in
page and user TSconfig, can be found in the
:ref:`TSconfig Reference <t3tsconfig:start>`.
