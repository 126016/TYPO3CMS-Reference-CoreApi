Role definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A TYPO3 integrator develops the template for a website, selects,
imports, installs and configures extensions and sets up access rights
and permissions for editors and other backend users. An integrator
usually has "administrator" access to the TYPO3 system, should have a
good knowledge of the general architecture of TYPO3 (frontend,
backend, extensions, TypoScript, TSconfig, etc.) and should be able to
configure a TYPO3 system properly and securely.

Integrators know how to use the Install Tool, the meaning of
configurations in "typo3conf/localconf.php"and the basic structure of
files and directories used by TYPO3.

The installation of TYPO3 on a web server or the configuration of the
server itself is not part of an integrator's duties (but of a system
administrator, see above). An integrator does not develop extensions
but should have basic programming skills and database knowledge.

The TYPO3 integrator knows how to configure a TYPO3 system, handed
over from a system administrator after the installation. An integrator
usually consults and trains editors (end-users of the system, e.g. a
customer) and works closely together with system administrators.

The role of a TYPO3 integrator often overlaps with a system
administrator and often one person is in both roles.
