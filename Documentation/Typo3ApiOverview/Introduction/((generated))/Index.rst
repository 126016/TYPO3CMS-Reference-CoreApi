Inline documentation
""""""""""""""""""""

We have dedicated ourselves to document the classes and methods inside
the source scripts (JavaDoc style). This means that you can use any
phpDoc compliant documentor program to extract API documentation from
the source. You can also install the extension "extdeveval" which
provides a menu in the top bar with links to the most important APIs
in TYPO3 from within the TYPO3 backend:

|img-11| Clicking a link like "div" will bring up a new window with
the full API of that class:

Pointers in the right direction
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The point of this documentation is to help you understand which parts
of the API are particularly important or useful for your TYPO3
hacking. The next pages will highlight functions and classes which you
should make yourself familiar with.
