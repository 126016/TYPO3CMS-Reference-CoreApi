JavaScript Coding Guidelines
============================

The rules suggested in the `Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
<https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>`__ should be used throughout the TYPO3
CMS core for JavaScript files.

Note that the TYPO3 core typically uses TypeScript now and automatically converts it to JavaScript.

Directories and filenames
=========================

* JavaScript files should have the file ending :file:`.js`

* JavaScript files are located under :file:`<extension>/Resources/Public/JavaScript/`

Format
======

* Use spaces, not TABs.

* Indent with 2 spaces.

* Use single quotes ('') for strings.

* Prefix jQuery object variables with a `$`.
