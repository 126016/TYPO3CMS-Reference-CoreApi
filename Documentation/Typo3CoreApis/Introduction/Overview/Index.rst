Overview
^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is known for its extensibility. However to really benefit from
this power, a complete documentation is needed. “Core APIs” and its
companion, “Inside TYPO3”, aim to provide such information to
developers and administrators. Not all areas are covered with the same
amount of details, but at least some pointers are provided.

"Inside TYPO3" contains the overall introduction to the architecture
of the TYPO3 core. It also contains API descriptions to a certain
degree but mostly in the form of examples and short table listings.
“Core APIs” goes into much more detail about such APIs and covers
subjects more closely related to development.

These documents do  *not* contain any significant information about
the frontend of TYPO3. Creating templates, setting up TypoScript
objects etc. is not the scope of these documents; they are about the
*backend* part of the core only.

The TYPO3 Core Team hopes that these two documents, "Inside TYPO3" and
"TYPO3 Core API", will form a complete picture of the TYPO3 Core
architecture, the backend and be the reference of choice in your work
with TYPO3. It took Kasper more than a year to get the first version
published and we've tried to maintain it as best we could.
