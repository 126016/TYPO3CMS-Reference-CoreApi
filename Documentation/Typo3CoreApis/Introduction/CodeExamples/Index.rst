Code examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the code examples found in this document come from the TYPO3
Core itself.

Quite a few others come from the “examples” extension which is
available in the TER. You can install it if you want to try out these
examples yourself and use them as a basis for your own stuff.

Yet some other examples just belong to this manual. Some may be moved
to the “examples” extension at some later stage.
