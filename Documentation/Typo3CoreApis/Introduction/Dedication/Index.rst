Dedication
^^^^^^^^^^

I want to dedicate this document to the people in the TYPO3 community
who have the  *discipline* to do the boring job of writing
documentation for their extensions or contribute to the TYPO3
documentation in general. It's great to have good coders, but it's
even more important to have coders with character to carry their work
through till the end - even when it means spending days writing good
documents. Go for completeness!
