Contexts
^^^^^^^^

There are two contexts where TypoScript is used: templates, where
TypoScript is used to actually define what will appear in the TYPO3 CMS
frontend, and TSconfig, where it is used to configure settings of the
TYPO3 backend. TSconfig is further subdivided into User TSconfig
(defined for backend users or user groups) and Page TSconfig (defined
for pages in the page tree).

Some parts of TypoScript are available in both contexts, some only in
one or the other. Any difference is mentioned at the according place.

Each context has its own chapter in this manual. It also has its own
reference in a separate manual (see :ref:`next-steps` at the end of
this manual).
