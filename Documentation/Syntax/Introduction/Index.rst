Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

TypoScript is like a (large) multidimensional PHP array (see "Appendix
A â€“ What is TypoScript?"). Values are arranged in a tree-like
hierarchy. The "branches" are indicated with periods (".") - a syntax
borrowed from for example JavaScript and which conveys the idea of
defining objects/properties.

Example:

::

   myObject = [value 1]
   myObject.myProperty = [value 2]
   myObject.myProperty.firstProperty = [value 3]
   myObject.myProperty.secondProperty = [value 4]

Referring to "myObject" we might call it an " *object with the value
[value 1] and the property, 'myProperty' with the value [value 2].
Furthermore 'myProperty' has its own two properties, 'firstProperty'
and 'secondProperty' with a value each ([value 3] and [value 4]).* "

The TYPO3 backend contains tools that can be used to visualize the
tree structure of TypoScript. They are described in the relevant
section further in this document (see "TypoScript Templates" and
"TSconfig"). The above piece of TypoScript would look like this:
