=====

* Comments: There is currently no consensous on how comments should be indented. Until a decision is made, the rules of the old CGL version will apply.

* There are parts of the old CGL document which are now missing. For most parts this is ok because they had nothing to do with CGL. However, we should collect that information and write it down somewhere (Wiki?).
  - TODO: List those parts here...
