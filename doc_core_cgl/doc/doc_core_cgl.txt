Introduction
About this document
This document defines coding guidelines for the TYPO3 project. Following these guidelines is mandatory for TYPO3 core developers and contributors to the TYPO3 core.
Extension authors are strongly encouraged to follow these guidelines when developing extensions for TYPO3. Following these guidelines makes it easier to read the code, analyze it for learning or perform code reviews. These guidelines also help to prevent typical errors in the TYPO3 code.
This document defines how TYPO3 code, files and directories should be structured and formatted. It does not teach how to program for TYPO3 and does not provide technical information about TYPO3.
Page numbers in this document refer to its printable version (available from the typo3.org web site).
Conventions used in this document
Monospace font is used for:
File names and directories. Directories have slash (/) in the end of the directory name.
Code examples
TYPO3 module names
Extension keys
TYPO3 namespaces (see page 5)
TYPO3 Frontend and Backend are spelled with the first letter in uppercase because they are seen as subsystems.
Contributing
If you have ideas for improving this document, if you want to suggest some new topic to cover or if you've found some mistakes, the best course is to open a bug report in the dedicated bug tracker (http://forge.typo3.org/repositories/show/typo3v4-doc_core_cgl).
Credits
The original TYPO3 coding guidelines document was written by Kasper Skårhøj. This document is written from scratch and based on the discussion between developers held at TYPO3 Developer Days in May 2008.
The information for this document was collected by Ingo Renner (TYPO3 core team member, release manager for TYPO3 4.2). The initial draft was produced by Dmitry Dulepov (TYPO3 core team member). The document is approved by the TYPO3 Core Team.
File system conventions
There are certain conventions about naming files and directories in the TYPO3 core and extensions. Some of them are historical and do not follow other formal rules. They will be described separately. New core classes and extensions are required to follow formal rules outlined below.
TYPO3 directory structure
By default a TYPO3 installation consists from the following directories:
Directory
Description
fileadmin/
This is a directory where users can store files. Typically images or HTML files appear in this directory and/or its subdirectories.
Often this directory is used for downloadable files. This directory is the only one accessible using the TYPO3 File module.
t3lib/
TYPO3 library directory
typo3/
TYPO3 Backend directory. This directory contains the Backend files.
Additionally, it contains some extensions in the ext/ (not used by the TYPO3 core) and sysext/ directories. For example, the "cms" extension contains the code for generating the Frontend website.
typo3conf/
TYPO3 configuration directory
typo3conf/ext/
Directory for TYPO3 extensions
typo3temp/
Directory for temporary files. It contains subdirectories for temporary files of extensions and TYPO3 components.
uploads/
Default upload directory. For example, all images uploaded with “Image with text” content element will be in this directory. Extensions can use uploadfolder setting in the ext_emconf.php to specify extension's own upload directory inside this directory.
This structure is default for TYPO3 installation. Other non-TYPO3 applications can add their own directories.
TYPO3 files and user files
All files in the TYPO3 web site directory hierarchy are divided to TYPO3 files and user files. TYPO3 files are files that come with the TYPO3 source package released by the TYPO3 core team. This includes files inside t3lib/ and typo3/ directories and the file named index.php in the root of TYPO3 installation
All other files are user files. This includes extensions, files in the fileadmin/ directory or files generated by TYPO3 (like thumbnails or temporary CSS files).
Extension directory structure
An extension directory contains the following files and directories:
Name
Description
ext_emconf.php
This is the only mandatory file in the extension. It describes extension to the rest of TYPO3.
ext_icon.gif
This is icon of the extension. The name may not be changed.
ext_localconf.php
This file contains hook definitions and plugin configuration. The name may not be changed.
ext_tables.php
This file contains table declarations. For more information about table declarations and definitions see the “TYPO3 Core API” document. The name may not be changed.
ext_tables.sql
This files contains definitions for extension tables. The name may not be changed.
The file may contain either a full table definition or a partial table. The full table definition declares extension's tables. It looks like a normal SQL CREATE TABLE statement.
The partial table definition contains a list of the fields that will be added to the existing table. Here is an example:
CREATE TABLE pages (
  tx_myext_field int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
);
Notice the comma after the field. In the full table definition it will be a error but in the partial table definition it is required. TYPO3 will merge this table definition to the existing table definition when comparing expected and actual table definitions. Partial definitions can also contain indexes and other directives. They can also change existing table fields though it is not recommended because it may create problems with the TYPO3 core and/or other extensions.
TYPO3 parses ext_tables.sql files. TYPO3 expects that all table definitions in this file look like the ones produced by the mysqldump utility. Incorrect definitions may not be recognized by the TYPO3 SQL parser.
tca.php
This file contains full table definitions for extension tables.
locallang*.xml
These files contains localizable labels. They can also appear in subdirectories.
doc/
This directory contains the extension manual. The name may not be changed.
doc/manual.sxw
This file contains extension manual in OpenOffice 1.0 format. The name or file format may not be changed. See the “Documentation template” document on the typo3.org for more information about extension manuals.
piX/
These directories contain Frontend plugins. If extension is generated by the Kickstarter, X will be a number. It is recommended to give more meaningful names to Frontend plugin directories.
svX/
These directories contain TYPO3 services. If extension is generated by the Kickstarter, X will be a number. It is recommended to give more meaningful names to service directories.
modX/
These directories commonly contain Backend modules. If extension is generated by the Kickstarter, X will be substituted with a number. It is recommended to give more meaningful names to Backend module directories.
modfuncX/
These directories commonly contain Backend submodules (embedded into other modules). If extension is generated by the Kickstarter, X will be a number. It is recommended to give more meaningful names to these directories.
lib/
Directory for non–TYPO3 files supplied with extension. TYPO3 is licensed under GPL version or 2 or any later version. Any non–TYPO3 code must be compatible with GPL version 2 or any later version. Note: this name is not mandatory but recommended.
This directory structure is strongly recommended. Extensions may create their own directories (for example, move all language files into other directories).
File names
TYPO3 requires all PHP class file names to start with class. prefix followed by a namespace prefix, underscore character, class name, underscore character and extension. For information on namespaces and namespace prefix, see the next section of this document. Extension for PHP files is always php.
Non-class files must not start with class. prefix. It is recommended to use only PHP classes and avoid non-class files.
Classes that contain PHP interfaces must have interface. prefix.
One file can contain only one class or interface.
File names must be all lower case.
Namespaces
TYPO3 logically separates all files and directories into several namespaces. These namespaces serve two purposes:
1.They show where a file or directory belongs inside TYPO3 CMS
2.They restrict PHP execution only to files from a certain namespace (for example, TYPO3 expects all callable functions to be in the user_ or tx_ namespace).
Sections below describe currently defined namespaces inside TYPO3.
t3lib
The t3lib namespace is reserved for common TYPO3 files. These files are used by both Frontend and Backend. Physically this namespace corresponds to the t3lib/ directory in the TYPO3 directory hierarchy.
All PHP class files in t3lib name space start with class.t3lib_ prefix.
The t3lib/ directory contains subdirectories. Class and interface files in these subdirectories have directory name appended to the t3lib_ prefix and separated from the class name by the underscore character. For example, files in the t3lib/cache/ are named like class.t3lib_cache_exception.php. Files inside t3lib/cache/backend are named like class.t3lib_cache_backend_abstractbackend.php.
User files are not allowed inside this namespace.
typo3
This namespace is reserved for TYPO3 Backend files. No user files are allowed here.
Historically files in this namespace have different prefixes and do not follow common naming rules.
tslib
tslib historically stands for “TypoScript library”. This namespace is part of cms extension. Physically it is located in typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/ directory and contains Frontend page and content generation files.
Files in this namespace historically may not follow common naming conventions.
User files are not allowed in this namespace.
tx_
This namespace is reserved for extensions. Extension PHP class files must start with class.tx_ prefix, followed by the extension key without underscores, another underscore and the name of the class in lower case. The file name ends with php extension. For example, if extension key is test_ext, the file name will be class.tx_testext_myclass.php and the  name of the class will be tx_testext_myClass.
User files from this namespace commonly found in typo3conf/ext/ directory. Optionally these files can be installed to the typo3/ext/ directory to be shared by many TYPO3 installations.
user_
This namespace is used for PHP files without PHP classes or for extensions local to a single installation. It is not recommended to create extensions with user_ prefix.
Non–class files contain PHP functions. These functions can be called by TYPO3 only if they have user_ prefix (the prefix can be changed by administrator in Install tool). All functions inside such files must have user_ prefix as well. Usually such files are placed inside fileadmin/ directory or its subdirectory.
ux_
This names space is reserved for XCLASS files. These files usually appear in extensions.
PHP file formatting
General requirements to PHP files
PHP tags
Each PHP file in TYPO3 must use full PHP tags. There must be exactly one pair of opening and closing tags (no closing and opening tags in the middle of the file). Example:
<?php
	// File content goes here
?>
There must be no empty lines after the closing PHP tag. Empty lines after closing tags break output compression in PHP and/or result in AJAX errors.
Line breaks
TYPO3 uses Unix line endings (\n, PHP chr(10)). If a developer uses Windows or Mac OS X platform, the editor must be configured to use Unix line endings.
Line length
Very long lines of code should be avoided for questions of readability. A line length of about 130 characters (including tabs) is fine. Longer lines should be split into several lines whenever possible. Each line fragment starting from the second must be indented with one more tab characters. Example:
$rows = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTgetRows('uid, title', 'pages',
	'pid=' . $this->fullQuoteStr($this->pid, 'pages') . $this->cObj->enableFields('pages'), 
	'', 'title');

or even better for readability:
$rows = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->exec_SELECTgetRows('uid, title',
	'pages',
	'pid=' . $this->fullQuoteStr($this->pid, 'pages') . $this->cObj->enableFields('pages'), 
	'',
	'title'
);

Comment lines should be kept within a limit of about 80 characters (excluding tabs) as it makes them easier to read.
Notes:
tabs are considered to be 4 spaces wide.
when splitting a line, try to split it at a point that makes as much sense as possible. In the above example, the line is split between two arguments and not in the middle of one. In case of long logical expressions, put the logical operator at the beginning of the next line, e.g.:
if ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['curlUse'] == '1'
	&& preg_match('/^(?:http|ftp)s?|s(?:ftp|cp):/', $url)) {
Whitespace and indentation
TYPO3 uses tab characters to indent source code. One indentation level is one tab.
There must be no white spaces in the end of a line. This can be done manually or using a text editor that takes care of this (see section “Settings for editors” on page 18).
Spaces must be added:
on both sides of string, arithmetic, assignment and other similar operators (for example, ., =, +, -, ?, :, *, etc)
after commas
in single line comments after the comment sign (double slash)
after asterisks in multiline comments
Character set
TYPO3 PHP files use iso-8859-1 character set.
All XML files use UTF-8 character set.
File structure
TYPO3 files use the following structure:
1.Opening PHP tag
2.Copyright notice
3.File information block (with optional function index) in phpDoc format
4.Included files
5.Class information block in phpDoc format
6.PHP class
7.XCLASS declaration
8.Optional module execution code (for example, in eID classes)
9.Closing PHP tag
The following sections discuss each of these parts.
Copyright notice
TYPO3 is released under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version. The copyright notice with a reference to the GPL must be included at the top of every TYPO3 PHP class file. user_ files must have this copyright notice as well. Example:
<?php
/***************************************************************

***************************************************************/

This notice may not be altered except for the year, author name and author e-mail.
File information block
File information block follows the copyright statement and provides basic information about the file. It should include file name, description of the file and information about the author (or authors). Example:
/**
 * class.tx_myext_pi1.php
 *
 * Provides XYZ plugin implementation.
 *
 * $Id: class.tx_myext_pi1.php 9514 2008-07-23 17:06:12Z john_doe $
 *
 * @author John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
 */

The example above uses SVN $Id$ meta keyword. SVN will expand it to a full version string when the file is committed.
The file information block can also contain the optional function index. This index is created and updated by the extdeveval extension.
Included files
Files are included using require_once function. All TYPO3 files must use absolute paths in calls to require_once. There are two ways to obtain the path to the included file:
1.Use one of the predefined TYPO3 constants: PATH_tslib, PATH_t3lib, PATH_typo3, PATH_site. The first three contain absolute paths to the corresponding TYPO3 directories. The last constant contains absolute path to the TYPO3 root directory. Example:
require_once(PATH_tslib . 'class.tslib_pibase.php');
2.Use t3lib_extMgm::extPath() function. This function accepts two arguments: extension key and path to the included file. The second argument is optional but recommended to use. Examples:
require_once(t3lib_extMgm::extPath('lang', 'lang.php'));
require_once(t3lib_extMgm::extPath('lang') . 'lang.php');

Always use one of these two ways to include files. This is required to include files even from the current directory. Some installations do not have the current directory in the PHP include path and require_once without a proper path will result in fatal PHP error.
Class information block
Class information block is similar to the file information block and describes the class in the file. Example:
/**
 * This class provides XYZ plugin implementation.
 *
 * @author John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
 * @author Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
 */
PHP class
PHP class follows the Class information block. PHP code must be formatted as described in chapter “PHP syntax formatting” on page 10.
The class name is expected to follow some conventions. The namespace and path parts (see “Namespaces” on page 5) are all lowercase and separated by underscores (“_”). At the end comes the “true” class name which must be written in upper camel case.
Taking again the example of file class.t3lib_cache_backend_abstractbackend.php, the PHP class declaration will look like:
class t3lib_cache_backend_AbstractBackend {
	…
}
XCLASS declaration
The XCLASS declaration must follow the PHP class. The format of the XCLASS is very important. Please follow the example below, otherwise the TYPO3 Extension Manager will complain about a missing XCLASS declaration.
The XCLASS declaration must include proper path to the current class file. The following example assumes that extension key is myext, file name is class.tx_myext_pi1.php and file is located in the pi1 subdirectory of the extension:
if (defined('TYPO3_MODE') && $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[TYPO3_MODE]['XCLASS']['ext/myext/pi1/class.tx_myext_pi1.php']) {
	include_once($TYPO3_CONF_VARS[TYPO3_MODE]['XCLASS']['ext/myext/pi1/class.tx_myext_pi1.php']);
}
Optional module execution code
Module execution code instantiates the class and runs its method(s). Typically this code can be found in eID scripts and old Backend modules. Here is how it may look like:
$controller = t3lib_div::makeInstance('tx_myext_ajaxcontroller');
$controller->main();

This code must appear after the XCLASS declaration. $SOBE is traditional but not required name.
PHP syntax formatting
Identifiers
All identifiers must use camelCase and start with a lower case letter. Underscore characters are not allowed. Abbreviations should be avoided. Examples of good identifiers:
$goodName
$anotherGoodName

Examples of bad identifiers:
$BAD_name
$unreasonablyLongNamesAreBadToo
$noAbbrAlwd

Identifier names must be descriptive. However it is allowed to use traditional integer variables like $i, $j, $k in for loops. If such variables are used, their meaning must be absolutely clear from the context where they are used.
The same rules apply to functions and class methods. Examples:
protected function getFeedbackForm()
public function processSubmission()

Class constants should be clear about what they define. Correct:
const USERLEVEL_MEMBER = 1;

Incorrect:
const UL_MEMBER = 1;

Variables on the global scope may use upper case and underscore characters.
Examples:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS
$TYPO3_DB
Comments
Comments in the code are highly welcome and recommended. Inline comments must precede the commented line and be indented by one tab. Example:
protected function processSubmission() {
		// Check if user is logged in
	if ($GLOBALS['TSFE']->fe_user->user['uid']) {
		…
	}
}

Class constants and variable comments should follow PHP doc style and precede the variable. Variable type must be specified for non–trivial types and optional for trivial types. Example:
	/** Number of images submitted by user */
	protected $numberOfImages;
	/**
	 * Local instance of tslib_cObj class
	 *
	 * @var tslib_cObj
	 */
	protected $localCobj;

Single line comments are allowed when there is no type declaration for the class variable or constant.
If a variable can hold values of different types, use mixed as type.
Debug output
During development it is allowed to use debug() or t3lib_div::debug() function calls to produce debug output. However all debug statements must be removed (removed, not commented!) before committing the code to the Subversion repository.
Curly braces
Usage of opening and closing curly braces is mandatory in all cases where they can be used according to PHP syntax (except case statements).
The opening curly brace is always on the same line as the preceding construction. There must be a space (not a tab!) before the opening brace. The opening brace is always followed by a new line.
The closing curly brace must start on a new line and be indented to the same level as the construct with the opening brace. Example:
protected function getForm() {
	if ($this->extendedForm) {
		// generate extended form here
	} else {
		// generate simple form here
	}
}

The following is not allowed:
protected function getForm()
{
	if ($this->extendedForm) { // generate extended form here
	} else {
		// generate simple form here
	}
}
Conditions
Conditions consist from if, elseif and else keywords. TYPO3 code must not use the else if construct.
The following is the correct layout for conditions:
	if ($this->processSubmission) {
		// Process submission here
	} elseif ($this->internalError) {
		// Handle internal error
	} else {
		// Something else here
	}

Here is an example of the incorrect layout:
	if ($this->processSubmission) {
		// Process submission here
	}
	elseif ($this->internalError) {
		// Handle internal error
	} else { // Something else here

It is recommended to create conditions so that shortest block goes first. For example:
	if (!$this->processSubmission) {
		// Generate error message, 2 lines
	} else {
		// Process submission, 30 lines
	}

If the condition is long, it must be split into several lines. Each condition on the line starting from the second should be indented with a two or more indents relative to the first line of the condition:
	if ($this->getSomeCodition($this->getSomeValiarble()) &&
			$this->getAnotherCondition()) {
		// Code follows here
	}

Ternary conditional operator must be used only if it has two outcomes. Example:
$result = ($useComma ? ',' : '.');

Wrong usage of ternary conditional operator:
$result = ($useComma ? ',' : $useDot ? '.' : ';');

Assignment in conditions should be avoided. However if it makes sense to do assignment in condition, it should be surrounded by the extra pair of brackets. Example:
	if (($fields = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_fetch_assoc($res))) {
		// Do something
	}

The following is allowed but not recommended:
	if (FALSE !== ($fields = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_fetch_assoc($res))) {
		// Do something
	}

The following is not allowed (missing the extra pair of brackets):
	while ($fields = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_fetch_assoc($res)) {
		// Do something
	}
Switch
case statements are indented with a single indent (tab) inside the switch statement. The code inside the case statements is further indented with a single indent. The break statement is aligned with the code. Only one break statement is allowed per case.
The default statement must be the last in the switch and must not have a break statement.
If one case block has to pass control into another case block without having a break, there must be a comment about it in the code.
Examples:
	switch ($useType) {
		case 'extended':
			$content .= $this->extendedUse();
			// Fall through
		case 'basic':
			$content .= $this->basicUse();
			break;
		default:
			$content .= $this->errorUse();
	}
Loops
The following loops can be used:
do
while
for
foreach
The use of each is not allowed in loops.
for loops must contain only variables inside (no function calls). The following is correct:
	$size = count($dataArray);
	for ($element = 0; $element < $size; $element++) {
		// Process element here
	}

The following is not allowed:
	for ($element = 0; $element < count($dataArray); $element++) {
		// Process element here
	}

do and while loops must use extra brackets if assignment happens in the loop:
	while (($fields = $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_fetch_assoc($res))) {
		// Do something
	}
Strings
All strings must use single quotes. Double quotes are allowed only to create the new line character (“\n”).
String concatenation operator must be surrounded by spaces. Example:
	$content = 'Hello ' . 'world!';

However the space after the concatenation operator must not be present if the operator is the last construction on the line. See the section about white spaces on page 7 for more information.
Variables must not be embedded into strings. Correct:
	$content = 'Hello ' . $userName;

Incorrect:
	$content = “Hello $userName”;

Multiline string concatenations are allowed. Line concatenation operator must be at the end of the line. Lines starting from the second must be indented relative to the first line. It is recommended to indent lines one level from the start of the string on the first level:
	$content = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ' .
				'Donec varius libero non nisi. Proin eros.';
Booleans
Booleans must use PHP's language constructs and not explicit integer values like 0 or 1. Furthermore they should be written in uppercase, i.e. TRUE and FALSE.
PHP5 features
The use of PHP5 features is strongly recommended for extensions and mandatory for the TYPO3 core versions 4.2 or greater.
Class functions must have access type specifier: public, protected or private. Notice that private may prevent XCLASSing of the class. Therefore private can be used only if it is absolutely necessary.
Class variables must use access specifier instead of var keyword.
Type hinting must be used when function expects array or an instance of a certain class. Example:
	protected function executeAction(tx_myext_action& $action, array $extraParameters) {
		// Do something
	}

Static functions must use static keyword. This keyword must be the first keyword in the function definition:
	static public function executeAction(tx_myext_action& $action, array $extraParameters) {
		// Do something
	}

abstract keyword also must be on the first position in the function declaration:
	abstract protected function render();
Global variables
Use of global is not recommended. Always use $GLOBALS['variable'].
Functions
If a function returns a value, it must always return it. The following is not allowed:
function extendedUse($enabled) {
	if ($enabled) {
		return 'Extended use';
	}
}

The following is the correct behavior:
function extendedUse($enabled) {
	$content = '';
	if ($enabled) {
		$content = 'Extended use';
	}
	return $content;
}

In general there should be a single return statement in the function (see the preceding example). However a function can return during parameter validation before it starts its main logic. Example:
function extendedUse($enabled, tx_myext_useparameters $useParameters) {
	// Validation
	if (count($useParameters->urlParts) < 5) {
		return 'Parameter validation failed';
	}

	// Main functionality
	$content = '';
	if ($enabled) {
		$content = 'Extended use';
	} else {
		$content = 'Only basic use is available to you!';
	}
	return $content;
}

Functions should not be long. “Long” is not defined in terms of lines. General rule is that function should fit into 2/3 of the screen. This rule allows small changes in the function without splitting the function further.
Using phpDoc
phpDoc is used for documenting source code. Typically TYPO3 code uses the following phpDoc keywords:
@author
@access
@global
@param
@package
@return
@see
@subpackage
@var

For more information on phpDoc see the phpDoc web site at http://www.phpdoc.org/
TYPO3 requires that each class, function and method is documented with phpDoc. For information on phpDoc with use in classes see “Class information block” on page 9.
Note that the @author tag should not be used in function or method phpDoc comment blocks – only at class level – because it is too liable to change frequently and authors would accumulate indefinitely. svn blame is enough for tracking changes.
Functions should have parameters and return type documented. Example:
/**
 * Initializes the plugin. Checks the configuration and substitutes defaults for missing values.
 * @param	array	$conf	Plugin configuration from TypoScript
 * @return	void
 * @see	tx_myext_class:anotherFunc()
 */
protected function initialize(array $conf) {
	// Do something
}

Notice the use of void when function does not return a value.
The ChangeLog file
TYPO3 core has a ChangeLog file where all changes are recorded. This file is committed to the SVN together with the change.
Each entry in the ChangeLog file has the following format:
Information about the date of the change (YYYY-mm-dd), author name and author's e-mail address. These three pieces of information are separated strictly by two spaces (no tabs!)
Empty line
One or more lines describing the change. Each such line is indented by a single tab
Empty line
Line that describes the change consists from the following parts:
Asterisk character
Type of the change (“Fixed bug” or “Added feature”)
Bug tracker issue id (“#12345”)
A colon
Bug tracker issue title or, if needed, a more meaningful title that describes the change (“great feature for TYPO3”)
Optional “thanks to” message of the patch was submitted by the contributor
In some cases the line can have free format. This applies to non–functional changes, like “Formatting change” or “Fixed copyright dates”).
Here is an example of the ChangeLog entry:
2009-01-06  John Doe  <john@doe.com>

	* Fixed bug #12345: typolink does not take XYZ into account
	* Added feature #12345: Google sitemap in the TYPO3 core (thanks to Jane Doe)

ChangeLog file updates are mandatory for every change in the TYPO3 core. Extension authors are strongly recommended to use such file with the same format in their extensions.
Coding: best practices
This section documents best practices when developing for TYPO3.
Accessing the database
The TYPO3 database should be always accessed through the use of $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']. This is the instance of t3lib_db class from t3lib/class.t3lib_db.php.
The same rule applies for accessing non-TYPO3 databases: they should be accessed by using a different instance of the same class. Failing this condition may corrupt TYPO3 database or prevent access to TYPO3 database for the rest of the script.
Singletons
TYPO3 supports singleton pattern for classes. Singletons are instantiated only once per HTTP request regardless of the number of calls to the t3lib_div::makeInstance(). To use singleton pattern class must implement t3lib_Singleton interface:
require_once(PATH_t3lib . 'interfaces/interface.t3lib_singleton.php');

class tx_myext_mySingletonClass implements t3lib_Singleton {
	…
}

This interface has no methods to implement.
Localization
TYPO3 is designed to be fully localizable. Hard-coded strings should thus be avoided unless there are some technical limitations (e.g. some early or low-level stuff where a lang object is not available).
Defining the localized strings
Here are some rules to respect when working with labels in locallang files:
always check the existing locallang files to see if a given localized string already exists, in particular EXT:lang/locallang_common.xml and EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml.
localized strings should never be all uppercase. If this is needed, then appropriate methods to make them uppercase should be used where needed.
localized strings must not be split into several parts to include stuff in their middle. Rather use a single string with sprintf() markers (%s, %d, etc.).
when a localized string contains several sprintf() markers, it must use numbered arguments (e.g. %1$d).
punctuation marks must be included in the localized string – including trailing marks – as different punctuation marks (e.g. “?” and “¿”) may be used in various languages. Also some languages include blanks before some punctuation marks.
localized strings are not supposed to contain HTML tags, except for CSH. They should be avoided whenever possible.
Once a localized string appears in a released version of TYPO3, it cannot be changed (unless it needs grammar or spelling fixes). Nor can it be removed. If the label a localized string has to be changed, a new one should be introduced instead.
Using the localized strings
Localized string are displayed using the available API, mostly lang::getLL() when the corresponding locallang file is loaded and lang::sL() otherwise. In both these methods, the second call parameter should be left out, unless there's a compelling reason to set it to TRUE (which triggers the use of htmlspecialchars()).
Unit tests
Using unit tests
Although the coverage is far from complete, there are already quite a lot of unit tests for the TYPO3 Core. Anytime something is changed in the Core, all existing unit tests must be run to ensure that nothing was broken.
Adding unit tests
The use of unit tests is strongly encouraged. Every time a new feature is introduced or an existing one is modified, a unit test should be added.

Settings for editors
Eclipse (PDT, Zend Studio, phpEclipse, etc)
Open Eclipse preferences. In the “General”, “Editors”, “Text editors”:
clear “Insert spaces for tabs”
check “Show print margin” and set “Print margin column” to 80
To clear trailing whitespace on save, install “AnyEdit” Eclipse plugin (find it on the Internet using your preferred search engine). Then in “General”, “Editors”, “AnyEdit tools” check two options: “Remove trailing whitespace” and “Convert tabs <-> spaces”. Also select “Spaces to tabs”.
In the “General”, “Workspace” set “New text file line delimiter” to “Other” and “Unix”.
Komodo IDE
Komodo IDE is a product of ActiveState. It is available at http://www.activestate.com/
In the Komodo IDE preferences select the “Editor” parameter group and from there select “Indentation”. Set options as follows:
Auto–indent style: Use Smart Indent
“Prefer tab characters over spaces” should be checked (in “Indentation” and “Language settings”/”PHP”)
“Number of spaces per indent” is set to 4
“Width of each tab character” is set to 4
In the “Smart editing” group set “Show edge line / Highlight characters beyond edge line” and enter “80” in the “Eddge line column”.
In the “Save options” group set “Clean trailing whitespace and EOL marker”.
In the “New files” group set “Specify end-of-line (EOL) indicator for newly created files” to “Unix (\n)”.
NetBeans
NetBeans is an open source IDE developed by Sun Inc. It is available at http://www.netbeans.org/.
Open the NetBeans preferences, move to the “Editor” preference panel and choose “Formatting”. Set options as follows:
From the menu “Category”, choose “Tabs And Indents”
Make sure the “Expand Tabs to Spaces” box is not checked
Set “Number of Spaces per Indent” to 4
Set “Tab Size” to 4
Set the “Right Margin” to 80
