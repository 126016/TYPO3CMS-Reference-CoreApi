 It will be possible to find deviations from this standard in the core of TYPO3 but that will be less than 1% cases and therefore there will be no doubt about the general style and standard of the code.
 We encourage everyone to bring their code up to this standard.Extension Review Scorecard
 For the extension review group there is a scorecard document which is listing a set of issues an extension reviewer will go through one by one. The scorecard will also be useful to read through this that is a more practical step-by-step guide to what makes an extension good.Visual formatting and naming

 Remember to put your own name in as copyright holder if you write something from scratch.
 If you modify a library you must document what you have changed (GPL requirement). Add your name as author / co-author to these modifications.
 The importance of the header is primarily to state that the code is GNU/GPL?ed. And remember only GPL?ed software is allowed to interface with TYPO3 (according to GPL itself).

 Put in a comment with the first line containing this string: [CLASS/FUNCTION INDEX of SCRIPT] - that will make the extdeveval function create an automatically maintained index of functions and classes when ever you use that extension to insert JavaDoc comments.
 This is an example. Notice that the standard header is followed by a file-comment in Javadoc style.
